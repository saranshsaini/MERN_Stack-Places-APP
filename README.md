# MERN_Stack-Places-APP

I made this web application in order to learn strengthen my React and Node knowledge while also learning Mongo and Mongoose.

This app allows users to share the locations they have visited with others, like a social media app. It uses the Google Maps API to display locations on a map.

The app features authentication, navigation, and a REST API. I plan on adding to the app by adding auto-login soon.
